    `According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyways. Because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.`,
    `To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. ðŸ˜‚ And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.`,
    `Up - Down - Up
When I up, down, touch the ground
It puts me in the mood
Up, down, touch the ground
In the mood for food
I am stout, round and I have found
Speaking poundage-wise
I improve my appetite when I exercise

Oh, yes, I'm rumbly in my tumbly
Time for something sweet

I am short, fat, and proud of that
And so with all my might
I up, down, up-down to
My appetite's delight
While I up, down, touch the ground
I think of things to chew
With a hefty, happy appetite I'm a hefty, happy Pooh
With a hefty, happy appetite he's a hefty, happy Pooh`
