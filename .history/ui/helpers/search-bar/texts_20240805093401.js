`Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,
To the last syllable of recorded time;
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player,
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,
And then is heard no more. It is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing.

`To be, or not to be, that is the question:\n
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer\n
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,\n
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles\n
And by opposing end them. To dieâ€”to sleep,\n
No more; and by a sleep to say we end\n
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks\n
That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation\n
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;\n
To sleep, perchance to dreamâ€”ay, there's the rub:\n
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,\n
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,\n
Must give us pauseâ€”there's the respect\n
That makes calamity of so long life.\n
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,\n
Th'oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,\n
The pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay,\n
The insolence of office, and the spurns\n
That patient merit of th'unworthy takes,\n
When he himself might his quietus make\n
With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,\n
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,\n
But that the dread of something after death,\n
The undiscovere'd country, from whose bourn\n
No traveller returns, puzzles the will,\n
And makes us rather bear those ills we have\n
Than fly to others that we know not of?\n
Thus conscience doth make cowards of us all,\n
And thus the native hue of resolution\n
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,\n
And enterprises of great pith and moment\n
With this regard their currents turn awry\n
And lose the name of action.\n`,

`my name is Dog\n
and betwixt the sheet\n
i fynd the toeses\n
they smell so sweet\n
i bide my tym\n
and take a beat\n
and then i stryk\n\n
i lik the feet\n`,

`my name is Cow,\n
and wen its nite,\n
or wen the moon\n
is shiyning brite,\n
and all the men
haf gon to bed -\n
i stay up late.\n
i lik the bred.\n`,

`Do it! Just do it! Don't let your dreams be dreams. Yesterday, you said tomorrow. So just do it! Make your dreams come true! Just do it! Some people dream of success, while you're gonna wake up and work hard at it! Nothing is impossible! You should get to the point where anyone else would quit, and you're not gonna stop there! No, what are you waiting for? Do it! Just do it! Yes you can! Just do it. If you're tired of starting over, stop giving up!`,

`According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyways. Because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.`,

`To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. ðŸ˜‚ And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.`,

`Up - Down - Up\n
When I up, down, touch the ground\n
It puts me in the mood\n
Up, down, touch the ground\n
In the mood for food\n
I am stout, round and I have found\n
Speaking poundage-wise\n
I improve my appetite when I exercise\n

Oh, yes, I'm rumbly in my tumbly\n
Time for something sweet\n

I am short, fat, and proud of that\n
And so with all my might\n
I up, down, up-down to\n
My appetite's delight\n
While I up, down, touch the ground\n
I think of things to chew\n
With a hefty, happy appetite I'm a hefty, happy Pooh\n
With a hefty, happy appetite he's a hefty, happy Pooh\n`,

`Whose woods these are I think I know.\n
His house is in the village though;\n
He will not see me stopping here\n
To watch his woods fill up with snow.\n

My little horse must think it queer\n
To stop without a farmhouse near\n
Between the woods and frozen lake\n
The darkest evening of the year.\n

He gives his harness bells a shake\n
To ask if there is some mistake.\n
The only other soundâ€™s the sweep\n
Of easy wind and downy flake.\n

The woods are lovely, dark and deep,\n 
But I have promises to keep,\n
And miles to go before I sleep,\n
And miles to go before I sleep.`
