`Do it! Just do it! Don't let your dreams be dreams. Yesterday, you said tomorrow. So just do it! Make your dreams come true! Just do it! Some people dream of success, while you're gonna wake up and work hard at it! Nothing is impossible! You should get to the point where anyone else would quit, and you're not gonna stop there! No, what are you waiting for? Do it! Just do it! Yes you can! Just do it. If you're tired of starting over, stop giving up!`,

`According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyways. Because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.`,

`To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. ðŸ˜‚ And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.`,

`Up - Down - Up\n
When I up, down, touch the ground\n
It puts me in the mood\n
Up, down, touch the ground\n
In the mood for food\n
I am stout, round and I have found\n
Speaking poundage-wise\n
I improve my appetite when I exercise\n

Oh, yes, I'm rumbly in my tumbly\n
Time for something sweet\n

I am short, fat, and proud of that\n
And so with all my might\n
I up, down, up-down to\n
My appetite's delight\n
While I up, down, touch the ground\n
I think of things to chew\n
With a hefty, happy appetite I'm a hefty, happy Pooh\n
With a hefty, happy appetite he's a hefty, happy Pooh\n`,

`Whose woods these are I think I know.\n
His house is in the village though;\n
He will not see me stopping here\n
To watch his woods fill up with snow.\n

My little horse must think it queer\n
To stop without a farmhouse near\n
Between the woods and frozen lake\n
The darkest evening of the year.\n

He gives his harness bells a shake\n
To ask if there is some mistake.\n
The only other soundâ€™s the sweep\n
Of easy wind and downy flake.\n

The woods are lovely, dark and deep,\n 
But I have promises to keep,\n
And miles to go before I sleep,\n
And miles to go before I sleep.`
